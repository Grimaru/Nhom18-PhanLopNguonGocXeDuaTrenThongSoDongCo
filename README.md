#### This is our second project using Google Colab in the 2nd semester of my 3rd year in the university.

#### I used three models for this project: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest. At first, I saw the result of all of three models are pretty low so I decided to use fine-tuning technique. In this project, I used GridSearchCV for the fine-tuning and after running all of three models, fortunately, they went higher for real.
